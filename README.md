## Use Case
You are going on a road trip with your friends. There are 4 of you in a rental car :
Alice, Bob, Claire and David. You are touring Ireland mainly because you all like stout
and sheeps.
You don&#39;t really know how long you will stay there, nor the price of gas or affordable
BnB availabilities... so you just can&#39;t draft a budget for this trip.
You decided with your friends that it would be easier if each one would pay some
stuff everyday, then sort out who owes money to who once you are back home.
